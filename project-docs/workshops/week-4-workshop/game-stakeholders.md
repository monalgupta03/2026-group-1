# Stakeholders

## Primary Stakeholders

### Players (End Users)

**Who:** People who play the game (testers, classmates, general players)

**Why they matter:**

- Their experience defines whether the game is fun, usable, and engaging
- They are directly affected by mechanics, controls, difficulty, UI, and performance

**Key interests:**

- Enjoyable gameplay
- Clear controls and feedback
- Fair difficulty and progression
- Stability (no crashes, bugs)

---

### Development Team

**Who:** Our group project members

**Why they matter:**

- You design, build, test, and maintain the game
- Decisions affect workload, deadlines, and code quality

**Key interests:**

- Clear scope and requirements
- Maintainable architecture
- Fair task distribution
- Meeting assessment criteria

---

## Secondary Stakeholders

### University / Teaching Staff

**Who:** Lecturers, tutors, and markers

**Why they matter:**

- They define the project requirements and grading rubric
- They evaluate the final product and process

**Key interests:**

- Evidence of software engineering practices
- Team collaboration and planning
- Clear documentation and justification of decisions
- A functional, complete submission

---

### Testers / Peer Reviewers

**Who:** Classmates, friends, or volunteers who playtest the game

**Why they matter:**

- They provide usability and gameplay feedback
- They help identify bugs and balance issues

**Key interests:**

- Clear instructions
- Playable builds
- Opportunity to provide feedback

---

## Tertiary Stakeholders

### Future Developers (Including us? maybe)

**Who:** Anyone who might maintain or extend the codebase later

**Why they matter:**

- Poor architecture increases technical debt
- Clear systems make future features easier

**Key interests:**

- Modular code structure
- Documentation
- Clear separation of systems

(This one scores *big* points in SE reports 👀)

---

### Community Users (If we add public features)

**Who:** Players using shared stats, achievements, or public databases

**Why they matter:**

- They interact indirectly via shared data
- Privacy, reliability, and fairness matter

**Key interests:**

- Data accuracy
- Privacy / anonymity
- Opt-in participation

---

## Indirect Stakeholders

- Platform providers (browser, p5.js)
    - Promotes/showcases use of p5.js library
    - Browsers are not made equal (most devs only consider chrome, it must work on university machines and thus work on firefox)
    - Play testing, optmisation
- Hardware limitations (low-end devices/platforms)
    - The game may or may not be playable on specific hardware, limiting the user-base or accessibility (if requires keyboard/game controller/mouse)
    - Hardware has different logic to account for when programing (eg. random is not calculated the same on all hardware mac vs windows)
    - Play testing, optimisation
